                        My name is Alexis Mitsuhashi. “Mitsu” means three and “hashi” means bridges. Many generations ago my family lived three bridges away from Mt. Fuji. I like to draw, paint, play drums, and dance. I live to eat, and speak okay Spanish and some Japanese.    </br></br>
						I am actively pursuing a job in data visualization and UX design. I am inspired by <a href=”https://bost.ocks.org/mike/” >Mike Bostock</a>, the creator of D3, and <a href=https://pudding.cool/>The Pudding </a> , a group of “journalist-engineers” that “[explain] ideas debated in culture with visual essays”. This past fall, I graduated from the University of Colorado Denver with a mixed degree in Geographic Information Systems and Human-Centered Design. In other words, I can certifiably make maps and solve complex problems systematically. My previous experience includes multiple internships in UX design, graphic design, and front-end production. I’ve been a research assistant for a study on sepsis death and volunteered for the National Park Service. For over six years, I’ve worked as a freelance illustrator and designer. </br></br>
