            Inworks is a Human-Centered Design school at the University of Colorado Denver. As their graphic illustrator, I was tasked with creating brand illustrations depicting their four tenets: design thinking, computational thinking, disruptive innovation, and radical interdisciplinarity. You can see them on the live Inworks site <a href=” http://inworks.ucdenver.edu/w/” >here </a>.

            I had to visualize four largely intangible concepts. Some of them have overlapping themes. There was also no precedent for illustrations in the Inworks branding, so I had free reign over styling.

          <p class="project-text">
            My process started with definitions for each tenet from the Inworks white paper. I translated that into five key words that came either directly from the definition or from whatever popped into mind while reading it. I also asked a few faculty and students what those tenets meant to them.  After a few sketches and lots of Adobe Illustrator, here are those brand illustrations:

              I also made a cool robot sticker.  This is used in the lab space to delineate which machinery can be left alone while working (such as the 3D printers).
