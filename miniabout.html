							I was inspired to study food deserts after watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown where he travels to Detroit. In the episode, he talks to local farmers who provide fresh produce to the area. It seemed unbelievable to me that there were <b>no supermarkets in Detroit</b>. In fact, there are approximately 18.3 million people living in food deserts in the U.S.<sup>1</sup> For this capstone project, I explored food deserts a little closer to home in Denver, CO. 
						</br></br>The food desert problem space is one that is well researched. Here is a summary defining the problem and exploring indicators: 
						</br></br>Supermarkets are a primary resource for healthy foods and fresh produce at prices that can be affordable to families and individuals that struggle economically. Unfortunately, such underserved communities can often be located in food deserts; according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, these are areas where at least 33% of the population in an urban census tract lives more than one half mile from a supermarket<sup>2</sup>. According to the CDC, this “can negatively affect health outcomes”<sup>3</sup>.
						</br></br>When healthy foods are difficult to obtain, individuals will often go to nearby convenience stores for higher calorie and less nutritious options. Those convenience store prices cannot compete with bulk prices of supermarkets and tend to be more expensive. This perpetuates the cycle of poverty and leads to poor eating habits and lifelong health issues.<sup>4</sup>
						</br></br>The demographic indicators for food deserts have also been explored. In food deserts, there are “higher percentages of African Americans (31% vs. 14%) and Hispanics (20% vs. 15%), lower educational attainment (24% vs. 15% without high-school diploma), [and a] higher percentage in poverty (25% vs. 13%)” <sup>1</sup>. Therefore this is an issue of social justice and is imperative in addressing the racial wealth gap. 
						</br></br>To develop an MVP for my capstone class, I reached out to local organizations that work towards increasing nutritional awareness and providing healthy food options for underserved neighborhoods. Working with directors from Groundwork Denver and The Growhaus, we identified visualizations of the problem space as one way that I could help their institutions. Some visuals are available online, but few have block group specificity or include demographic factors. 
						
					
					<p id="interactive"></br>For the interactive map, block group shapefiles were obtained from the 2018 TIGER/Line Shapefiles and Demographic Indicators (Percent Population High School Graduate or Above, Black or African American Population, Hispanic Population, and Percent Below Poverty Level) were obtained from the American Community Survey 2017 5-Year Estimates. That data is provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. I used the demographic indicators cited by Wu et. al., but used higher percentages to narrow the scope and highlight the highest concentrations of each indicator. 
					</p>
					<p id="income"></br>The median income map uses the TIGER/Line block group shapefiles and median household income in the past 12 months (in 2016 inflation-adjusted dollars) from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates for 2012-2016 provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Denver Food Store location data was obtained from the City and County of Denver’s Open Data Catalog and was updated January 2018. 
					</p>	
					<p id="scatter"></br>For the scatterplot, a one-mile buffer was created around each census block group and the number of supermarkets within that one-mile buffer were calculated (one mile was used since this is another distance used by some USDA tools and narrowed the scope to neighborhoods most affected). The number of grocery stores within one mile was then plotted against median income of those block groups. This scatterplot illustrates that increased supermarket access is correlated to income. Adding a linear regression provides that for each $5,544.28 increase in income, there is an average increase of one more supermarket within a mile of a block group. A family or individual with an income of $45,482 can on average expect to have no supermarkets within one mile of their home. This is a statistically significant relationship with a p-value of less than 0.0001. 
					</p>	
					</br>I had a great time working with Groundwork Denver and The Growhaus on this project. Thank you to Fatuma at Groundwork Denver for being an exceptional resource and counsel. There are a number of assumptions made during the statistical analysis (ex. population is not evenly distributed within a block group) and the ACS is not the most reliable dataset (large margins of error). But enjoy these maps as first looks at what we could be providing to our neighbors, city planners and legislators. The power of an approachable visual representation cannot be understated, and hopefully we can incorporate more of them into our world of complex relationships.
